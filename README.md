# Hack the Commute Hackathon: OneBusAwaze

The purpose of this app is to provide transit riders and users of One Bus Away (OBA) the ability to crowd source issues encoutered with their bus. These issues could include whether a bus is full and not accepting more riders (MVP example), whether the bus is disabled, affected by a reroute etc. Users will be able to report issues for a given route or stop that will be then be viewable to other downstream riders. Issues will appear attached ot buses or routes when viewed at a stop. The report data will be maintained to allow for analysis or recurring issues in the network and act as feedback for regional transit agencies.  

This application was developed on March 21st, 2015 for the [Hack the Commute Hackathon](https://codeforseattle.hackpad.com/Hack-the-Commute-2h8AsgMYcB8).
